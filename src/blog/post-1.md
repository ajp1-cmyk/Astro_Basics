Welcome to my _new blog_ about building a blog in astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a the blog.

## What I've accomplished:
1. **Scaffolding the base**: Scaffolding is easy astro provides great docs and articles about this
2. **Making Pages**: creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder creates webpages that can be visited using the file route name itself.
